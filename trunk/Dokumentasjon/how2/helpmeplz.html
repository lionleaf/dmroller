Above you can see an image of what the DMR alpha interface looks like. There are 3 buttons, their functions are explained below.
<ul>
    <li>1: This button brings up the window interface where the user inputs data about new monsters to add to the encounter.</li>
    <li>2: This button refreshes the window.</li>
    <li>3: This button deletes fucking everything. That means it deletes all the monsters, effectively resetting the encounter.</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />

The above picture is of the "Add Monster" interface. There are many input fields, and their functions are explained below.
<ul>
    <li>1: This is where name of the monster goes. Its primary function is to let the user easily identify the different monsters they have added to the encounter.</li>
    <li>2: Type. If you play D&D4.0 you'll know what this is, if not, don't bother with it.<br />Once you have selected a type, the HP and AP field will adjust accordingly.</li>
    <li>3: The amount of hitpoints the monster has. If type is set to "minion", this is forced to 1.</li>
    <li>4: The amount of Action Points the monster has. This is not yet an adjustable value, and is decided by the monster's type as per D&D4.0 rules.</li>
    <li>5: The Ability field. Within it are the following:<br />
    The name of the ability, used to tell a monster's abilities apart.<br />
    The +hit bonus the ability has (entered without the '+') and what the attack is against (AC, Reflex, Fortitude or Will).<br />
    The damage the ability does. Entered as "3d8+1d4+18" (for example).<br />
    Additional info about the ability. Fluff text, conditions etc.</li>
    <li>6: Adds a new ability field in order for the user to add additional abilities.</li>
    <li>7: Submits the data and adds the monster to the encounter (assuming the input is legal)</li>
</ul>

Above is a filled out form for a "Goblin", named Goblin.<br /><br />

<img src="pic3.jpg"><br />
Above is what the encounter will look like if "Goblin" is added to it.<br />
Goblin can be dragged around by clicking and dragging the "drag" text.<br />
Clicking "Roll!" will roll the dice for Goblin's "Hit" ability.<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="pic4.jpg"><br />
Above is a picture of what it'll look like if you roll Goblin's "Hit" ability.<br />
Mousing over the "Hit: x" and "Damage: x"-text will show you what value each die had.
